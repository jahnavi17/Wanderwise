🌍 1. User Source Location Input

Add an input field labeled “Your Location” at the top of the app (above the chat or hero section).

Placeholder: “Where are you traveling from?”

It should be optional, but if entered, the AI will receive this as part of the prompt — e.g.

“Suggest destinations within 5 hours of flight from [User Location].”

Store this location in local state so it persists during the session.

Use a location pin icon (📍) beside the input.

Style: glassmorphic or rounded card input consistent with the rest of the design.

💰 2. Budget Input with Default INR

Add a budget selector near the main input area:

A number input or slider labeled “Budget” (range ₹10,000 – ₹5,00,000).

Default currency: INR (₹).

Add a small dropdown next to it for currency selection with these options:

INR (₹)

USD ($)

EUR (€)

GBP (£)

When the currency changes, update the label dynamically (e.g., “Budget: $2000”).

Ensure the selected currency is passed to the AI prompt context.
Example:

“I have a budget of 1,00,000 INR. Suggest destinations under this budget.”

Maintain light, colorful styling — slider or numeric input should match theme colors (sky blue or coral orange).

🗺️ 3. Country Filter (Optional Input)

Below or beside the main chat input, add another optional field labeled:

“Limit destinations to this country (optional)”

Placeholder: “e.g., Italy, Japan, India”

If a user enters a country, the AI prompt should include:

“Show only destinations within [Country].”

Add a small globe icon 🌐 beside the field.

Keep the design compact — use a grid layout to neatly align “Your Location,” “Budget,” and “Country” fields.

💡 4. Integration Logic

Update the main API call or prompt construction logic so it dynamically includes these details (only if filled):

const prompt = `
Suggest travel destinations for a user with:
- Starting point: ${userLocation || "Not specified"}
- Budget: ${budget} ${currency}
- Preferred country: ${country || "Any"}
`;


Send this combined prompt to the OpenAI API as part of the recommendation flow.

Ensure empty fields don’t break the UI or the request.

🎨 5. UI Design Notes

Keep all inputs inside a glassmorphism-styled card or container with rounded corners and shadow.

Use small travel-related icons for each input.

Add responsive layout:

On desktop: show all 3 fields in one row.

On mobile: stack them vertically with soft spacing.

Animate field focus with a subtle glow (matching the theme color).

🎯 Goal

These new inputs should make the AI recommendations more personalized and context-aware.

Ensure they integrate smoothly into the existing app flow without breaking the chat or design layout.

Keep performance optimized and API calls minimal.
