🧭 1. Hero Section (Top of the Page)

Add a vibrant hero section with:

A gradient background or soft looping travel-themed video (beach, sky, mountain timelapse).

A catchy tagline like: “Find your next adventure with AI ✈️”

A subheading: “Smart travel recommendations tailored just for you.”

One prominent button: “Get Started” that scrolls down to the chat/input area.

Use Poppins (bold) and Quicksand (body) from Google Fonts.

🌅 2. Dynamic Backgrounds

Make the app’s background change based on the recommended destination type:

Beach → light turquoise gradient.

Mountains → cool blue tones.

City → neutral grey with orange accents.

Nature → green and beige.

Transition backgrounds smoothly with CSS gradient animations or Framer Motion.

💬 3. Chat-based Recommendation Flow

Transform the plain input-output format into a chat-style interface with alternating user and AI message bubbles.

Use glassmorphism effects for chat bubbles.

Each AI message should show:

Destination name in bold.

A small image thumbnail (use Unsplash API or placeholder URLs).

A 1-line reason why it’s recommended (“Perfect for romantic getaways” etc.).

Add small emoji reactions (❤️ 👍 🌍) below AI messages for engagement.

Add a soft animation (e.g., “plane flying” or “dots loading”) when AI is generating a response.

🗺️ 4. Quick Filter Chips

Above the chat input, show clickable chips like:

🌊 Beaches

🏔️ Mountains

🏙️ City Escapes

💰 Budget Trips

🌸 Romantic Getaways

When clicked, the chip sends that as a prompt to the AI automatically.

Chips should have gradient backgrounds, rounded edges, and hover animations.

📸 5. AI Inspiration Carousel

Below the chat, display a horizontal scroll carousel of travel inspirations.

Each card contains:

A beautiful Unsplash image.

Destination name.

A short AI-generated caption (from your existing recommendations).

Use auto-scroll and hover zoom effects for an immersive feel.

🧳 6. Shareable Travel Cards

For each AI recommendation, generate a travel card with:

Destination image, name, budget range, and best travel season.

A “Share” button to copy a link or download the card as an image (optional).

Add hover effects and smooth transitions between cards.

🌈 7. Mood-based Theme Switcher

Add a small floating toggle on the top-right corner labeled “Mood 🎨”.

When clicked, it cycles through themes:

Adventure → Orange-red tones

Relax → Blue-cyan tones

Romantic → Pink-lilac tones

Luxury → Gold-black tones

The entire app’s background, buttons, and highlight colors change accordingly.

🎡 8. Surprise Me Button

Add a fun “🎡 Surprise Me!” button below the input box.

When clicked, it randomly suggests a travel destination (use a static list to avoid API overuse).

Animate it with a small spinner or dice roll animation.
